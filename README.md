## Environment Variables 🌱

For DMParser to work correctly, you'll need to set up a `.env` file in the root directory. This file should contain various configuration options, such as API keys or database connection strings.

### Example `.env` file

```dotenv
# .env file

# API Key for third-party messaging service
API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Database connection string
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname

# Other configurations
DEBUG=True
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

> **Note:** Replace `your_api_key_here`, `username`, `password`, `localhost`, `5432`, and `dbname` with your actual configuration values.

## Usage 📖

Once you've set up your environment, you can run DMParser as follows:

```bash
python main.py --input path/to/your/dm_file.txt
```

For additional options, check out the help flag:
